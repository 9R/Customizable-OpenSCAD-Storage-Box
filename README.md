# Ultimate OpenScad Storage Containers

This is the attempt to create a storage container generator in OpenSCAD.

When finished this should allow to generate stackable and interlocking
containers with lids according to user input dimensions. Other options like
inner dividers, various surface features should be adjustable as well.

## Web Customizer
Alternative to loading the .scad file in OpenSCAD client there is a web 
customizer available at [9R.github.io/OpenSCAD-Web-Customizer](https://9R.github.io/OpenSCAD-Web-Customizer).

## Notice
Currently this is a work in progress. Compatibility in terms of stacking,
interlocking etc to future versions of this project is not guaranteed at
the moment.
